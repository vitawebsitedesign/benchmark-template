# What
Project template for the [.NET Core benchmarking](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) library.

This template was made because i just like to jump to the benchmarking action.

# Install
```console
git clone git@github.com:vitawebsitedesign/benchmark-template.git
```

# Usage
You can start the benchmarks immediately because this template already comes with 2 example benchmarks.

Just open solution in VS2019 & click "Debug > Start Without Debugging" button.
